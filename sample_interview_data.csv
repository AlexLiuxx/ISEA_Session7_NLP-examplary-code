Educator,3,"So speaking at a local district level, we have had our first equity policy was approved last year, which is really exciting under our new superintendent that we have, and that was a big work. We had a director of equity for the first time ever last year, full time. Unfortunately, he left to go to the west side, and so we have another person who is just point four and not necessarily in that leadership capacity, but that has been some really exciting work that I think our district has taken on."
Educator,11,"I know that my field, the area of my expertise is really in language development and working with students who are learning English as a new language, and so I feel a lot of frustration around local policies in terms of equity around our multilingual learners. For me, that is the world that I tried to use advocacy in my local district for, and have not seen significant changes in many years."
Educator,12,"In terms of local policies, something that can be limiting is the emphasis on compliance. I was a teacher in the district, and then I left for several years, and then I came back as a professional-development specialist around English learners. One of the things that happened is it was all about compliance, which is great that compliance without impact or compliance without..."
Educator,13,"I think you were talking before about this data policy feedback-loop. So just to make sure that we are doing things just to check boxes is a huge frustration in terms of that ground that...I think the upper administrators, their job is basically to keep us in compliance. I mean, I understand that is a big responsibility."
Educator,14,"As a educator who works with students directly, my job is to make sure that I am giving the best situation for my students, and so a lot of times, there is this disconnect what students need and the compliance piece, making sure that we are just getting the compliance, I think that sometimes can be a frustration, for example, around English language development services for students."
Educator,15,"That is a federal requirement that civil that we provide English language development services to all students, but what that looks like many times can be a check box, or maybe it could be segregation, maybe it could be a not really meaningful instruction. We are able to check the box that what is happened, but as a result, we may have students six years in an ESL One class never having access to grade level curriculum."
Educator,16,"I think that that is an issue that is well-intentioned policies that are needed to be, but without the piece of the impact in terms of students and not understanding of what students...student-based decisions I think it is that is the frustration."
Educator,17,"Just to paraphrase, the other way of putting this will be like, Although we check the box, we are providing services to this group of students, but we should be more thinking about the quality of the services we would provide to them, or we have really served their needs (Thank you. Yes, I think so)."
Educator,18,"In terms of what is the quality that we are having, in terms of...in our region, it is really teacher dependent, and so I am not advocating that we like to have some set curriculum, but teachers are coming in with a variety of different backgrounds and experiences, and so having this common understanding even amongst administration, even at the state level all the way down."
Educator,19,"I know I had some conversations last year with Superintendent Reykdal, I am a big proponent of his dual language initiatives that he is proposing. Along with that is we have to ensure students have whatever language skills they need to be able to do whatever they want to with their lives. That is the ultimate goal. That they get choices to do what they want to with their future, and in our country now, that is also English language development, and so this lack of understanding around how do we make really meaningful language development in honor students, native languages, and heritage languages? Yes, absolutely, and that also has to go in tandem with making sure we are giving kids the skills that they need to be able to have access to what they want to be doing in life."
Educator,20,"In another word, the quality here actually have, at the minimum, two folds as I am hearing, one will be really during the implementation will be the quality of the program or instructional program or services well provide to these students. The other you are actually talking about towards the end, the students outcome. Are they really have the language skill or other type of outcome and skills and knowledge to be able to fully participate in all these different program opportunity offered to the main schools by having that language skill? (Yes, absolutely, thank you)."
Educator,21,"One of the challenges we have is that in terms of resources, we do get the grant through the best funding. So this year, we have lets say 57 brand new to the profession educators. I am a full release mentor full-time, and then I have a colleague who is part-time. We run the program, so we do all the professional-learning for all of our mentees, we do the stakeholder meeting, we do a variety of things that are outside of the role of just direct mentoring. Obviously, that is a large number of mentees to have for one point five people, it is a lot."
Educator,22,"Again, some of our new educators, just given the situation they had last year, need more intensive amounts of support, so we are spread pretty thin, so in terms of getting additional personnel to do this really important work would be awesome, because part of the benefit of this role is that we are really trying to have a focus on equity, and we are really trying to support our new educators in most equitable practices from the very beginning, and believing that if you start this way, then you are just going to build your practice and instructions really critical."
Educator,23,"In terms of financial resources, definitely, I would love to have more mentors because we are not able to really mentor our year two teachers. We know last year, everything was online, so this is really their first year teaching, and so that is a frustration, and that is a limitation that we have in terms of the support that we can provide, in terms of how we use the money, I agree wholeheartedly."
Educator,24,"I am new to this position, so I am still trying to find what is the most effective and efficient way to do this work. And our district in the past had different models, where maybe it was a colleague mentor, and that was we facilitated the professional-learning and then colleague mentor, which was great, but not all of our colleague mentors can attend in-depth training and especially around issues of equity. Then what is being mentored and what is being supported is harder to, I guess, measure in terms of that we are all trying to advocate for the same definition of equity and work moving forward."
Educator,25,"I think it is really interesting this question about how do we support early educators in terms of developing that equity lens, and making sure that were using our funds efficiently. I think that is always a really big question. Especially to, what would be the data to show that we were effective in our role in terms of supporting early career educators? I think that that is a really good question and I am not sure what that looks like and it is something we have had conversations around."
Local administrators/board members,109,"We are also a system that is kind of yet to specifically name some of the specific practices but have various initiatives and efforts that are geared in those spaces. So I can zoom in different points on kind of that, but I think were very much on a journey to kind of understanding where do these things meet, where do our values and our measures meet also at a time where we are very focused and our leadership is very focused on student outcomes in particular."
Local administrators/board members,110,"So students-of-color from educational justice is like actually specific subgroup of students, includes Southeast Asian students, American Indian students, African American females, they are like discreet groups from African American males."
Local administrators/board members,111,"And I think it came from, this predates my time in the district, but really came from some work, looking at opportunities and access barriers and really understanding historically who is least served by the system. And I think in a lot of ways was an opportunity to then create an aggregate group with the hopes that, that would not be as problematic as I think what our state does and what SPS honestly did kind of back when I was at CCR or we and others were in like lots of conversation around choices to aggregate White and Asian, which was this huge, huge grouping that was very problematic against all other students and kind of measuring that gap as monitoring measuring progress."
Local administrators/board members,112,"So this was, and from, again, my kind of purview you of a former outsider, no insider, as like really trying to focus on a group of students, but within there is huge, huge variance and also a lot of different experiences."
Local administrators/board members,113,"It is specifically defined but also something as a system that we revisit constantly. So right now we have, and this maybe takes us down another rabbit hole into racial identification and sub race. So per house bill 1541, like SPS is just now, kind of integrating that into our database. What is exciting about that is it also creates a subgroup for Middle Eastern, North African students to be more visible in our database, and so it has brought up to some really good conversations around, including those students who were previously aggregated into White to now be a part of our students-of-color group."
Local administrators/board members,114,"there is a lot of functional goals that come with making this aggregate, but then there is also a lot of harm that comes with that too. In my view necessitate, it then might prevent us as a system from taking the needed deep dives to truly understand nuances within communities when we have such a focus and at the same time becomes at least a through line across strategies, so leaders are focused on the students who are disproportionately impacted, so I definitely see both sides and some other rationale there."
Local administrators/board members,115,"It does is I think in a lot of ways we are still grappling with those questions and again, this is whereas a system that is also committed to transparency and wanting to have stated goals and targets and measures. There is always going to be that degree to which an aggregate outcome for specific measure and a specific group of students is relevant. So I think we are still kind of holding both things as true where we are in spaces where we are pursuing a lot of really nuanced conversations."
Local administrators/board members,116,"Ao last year I had the opportunity to lead conversations with black students and parents just across the diaspora to really understand nuances and their learning experiences. And we are going to be doing some similar work at the elementary grades. And I think where these qualitative and mixed methods, inquiries often take us is from my kind of bias into these spaces of deeper inquiry. We can kind of understanding variance by immigration status and lots of these other factors and at its best then making sure that there is clear feedback-loops to our specific strategies."
Local administrators/board members,117,"So I think there is this continuous improvement goal. That is really around these deeper inquiries and also kind of more recurring reporting that I think the gap that I see and the one that kind of you named around, how do we then track progress is then in kind of these measurable goals and that is where we find ourselves today."
Local administrators/board members,118,"So the board has come up with some kind of focused area goals. So there is four areas. It is really kind of like a deepening of the strategic plan that is happening right now, focusing on third grade reading, seventh grade math, I forget which grade science and then a college to career goal. And in those spaces, there is a set of goals and there is a set of guardrails as well. Kind of anyway, I can share all of this. it is going to be public pretty soon as and our board has started to have community meetings around them, which is a great move to really, yeah."
Local administrators/board members,119,"Kind of have some of these conversations around, how can we be so focused on student outcomes that really acknowledge that it is our systems and structures that need to change. So, yeah, I will not be able to fully answer it because we are very much in the pros of figuring out what does that reporting look like? There is a big need and interest in figuring out what public reporting can look like."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,159,"We definitely know that the finances can have an impact. things recently that have been done, there is been some investments in LAP, which is learning assistance program that does go out based on a poverty factor. So that at least helps some of our school districts that do not have the same economic resources, which are often our more diverse school districts as well."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,160,"Things that we have put into the system like levy equalization support also often helps some of the school districts keep up with the districts that have more buying power from their property tax base. None of that is perfect, in any measure."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,161,"When the state moved away from staff mix, when they went away from a salary structure that they funded and went to an average salary, that should have had some help for certain districts. but I think when we looked at it, honestly, when we look at the outcome, once you layer on regionalization, some other things that may not have had the same impacts that I think people were hoping for. Maybe it did not make things worse yet again. Maybe it was one thing that helped moderate things, but when you put the regionalization factor on, there is still some disparate impacts."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,162,"I think Federal-Way was one of the prime examples before. A very diverse high cost of living area that had a low staff mix, so they were getting less per student. But now, they are still at the south corner of King County. They are not getting the same regionalization as Bellevue and Seattle and some other areas. So they still did not maybe get all the benefit that we might want to see directed at such a diverse community."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,163,"One of the things that I would add in this front is that local school-board had a play also in how local schools are being managed. So one of the things that we have been engaging is working at the electoral level to make sure that we elect equally driven board members because again, a lot of those issues are political in nature in how you are able to address the situation at the school level."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,164,"I was reflecting on one and I think it is the flip side of a lot of the policies we want to make progress on. We are looking for a more diverse workforce, but yet many of our diverse educators that we bring in, there is so much turnover. they are tapped to be on every committee and so many things. And I do not know if it is a specific state policy that is holding that back or just a lack of states support and a lack of local support that is hampering some of that."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,165,"So that is why I cannot come up with a specific policy that is having a bad impact that I can think of now, but I can think of plenty of places where we have gaps where maybe the lack of action is, by default, a policy."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,166,One of the things that jump off has been the impact of mental health in Australian population. The governor utilized an emergency proclamation to reopen schools in purpose because the going mental health crisis in the state of Washington.
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,167,"I think that for this unit, it is important to note the lack of necessary mental health resources for students around the state. We have been supportive of adding more wraparound services available for students, and COVID-19 has raised the impact that the mental health crisis have been having on our students due to the lack of resources available."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,168,"We also see that students-of-color have been the recipient of added pressure because of COVID-19, and that was not taken into full consideration from the economy can certainly... The fact that COVID-19 has impacted communities-of-color to a large extent as community, but we also saw this past couple of months or more, lots of state sanctioned violence on our television screen, which has impacted communities-of-color, in particular African American community, quite a bit prior to the return to school."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,169,"So I think that there is a going list of potential reason for mental health crisis that has not been addressed that is compounded for communities-of-color, which creates pretty much a reason for us to go out and prioritize mental health resources in our schools going forward."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,170,"Add on there are gaps in accessibility to mental health supports for the entire population, but especially for students. What we find is most students who get any level of mental health support, it is often starting in schools. So we view that as an equity policy to get more mental health providers out in all schools, that is like nurses, counselors, social workers, psychologists."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,171,"That is what we are aimed at pushing for in the legislature and to get so that it is not just certain school districts who have enough money to prioritize them, but all school districts to be able to have that service and where we can encourage schools to be partners with creating school health centers, could be an equity issue where we can help fill in some gaps of providers and communities if we can partner them with schools."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,172,"We often use a lot of the OSPI data, whether that is on educator data or student data. I have been diving into their discipline data. I can get volumes of data, but having the easier tools to help smarize, so you can help find some differences between districts would be helpful and crossing."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,173,"There are lots of different data sets within OSPI and ways to marry those up because sometimes I have a question over here that I want to tag over here, but I really cannot merge the call. I could with a lot of time, but I do not always have that time."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,174,"Then in terms of effectiveness of programs, one thing I was going to say back on the diverse educators is we are looking at things like doing a better job of grow your own. I do not know how we get data measures on that, but finding ways to show what recruitment approaches might be helpful. we have looked at paying student teachers for their time. that can be a hurdle based on economic status. So we believe those are good strategies, but if there is data to help us support that all the better."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,175,"just to talk about this, not just about the OSPI data they typically collect about sort of for accountability purpose, like a breakdown by there is a different group of students and there are different sort of data, but they sort of like house data or host it different places and it is not so easily to merge them together to look at the practical policy question folks that are interested in because it is oftentimes informed by multiple data points."
State administrators/legislators/board,208,"And I do not think the extra dollars were recently released under the COVID-19 stimulus packages have been helpful in clarifying that; now, people are scrambling to spend more funds we are hearing ESD say, ""Oh, we used to charge for service A and C, and we used to give services, X, Y, and Z for free, but now schools are saying, we want to pay for X, Y, and Z too because we have all this money and we have to spend on certain things and it is one of those certain things we can spend out; we know it is free, but now we want to pay for it."""
State administrators/legislators/board,209,"There is an influx sometimes of funds and programs and initiatives, and then they dissipate, so there is no concrete moment where schools can say, ""I am going to have this my money and I am going to have it for 20 years, and I know that I have 20 years out and I can plan this long term;"" So I think there is a lot of, it is time to fund, but the influx of those initiatives that may or may not last, that may or may not be coordinated in a way that may actually help students instead of just became more hectic."
State administrators/legislators/board,210,"Having been a teacher in school, I can definitely say, ""yeah, I have felt a pull of different funds and people approach me and say, these are principles, ""We have X amount of dollars to do this thing, Do you want to do it? because we got to spend this money,"" and being like, ""we do not have any price, we are doing this thing and this thing and this thing and this thing;"" so I think that is a problem."
State administrators/legislators/board,211,"Yeah. I would say we are. And we have been working with our ESD (Education System Data) store CSA (Coordinated Service Agreement), trying to figure out how to coordinate these services; and one of the things that we have had, as I mentioned, our office is recently overturned, so now we have a whole different group programs coming in and trying to figure out, ""okay, we were starting to get some traction in our old version and now we lost some and we have more coming in, and how do we reshift those policies?"""
State administrators/legislators/board,212,"So now we are talking about these things working together, and do we also maintain that we tandem with that group that is now no longer part of our office? because now it is just starting to do we hang onto what is over here as we try to bring in what is over here, or do we let this go and focus on this new, but been an ongoing discussion because that other group was about 15 people; there was a lot of coordination and a lot of time putting into that, developing that system, but it also will be a lot of time to maintain it as we try to put more time into this other group."
State administrators/legislators/board,213,"Give and take in terms of how are we collaborating and coordinating services, there is a limitation and capacity and time to do meaningful collaboration coordination with everyone."
State administrators/legislators/board,214,"That old group was called K-12 Supports, and if you think of the tiered system I talked about earlier, tier foundational, tier one, tier two, tier three, and our work is focused on the top, we shape it like pyramid; K-12 supports, on the other hand, was at the bottom lower end, they are focused on what are the universal supports that will benefit tier three through foundational schools, and the argument here is, if it benefits a tier three school, it is probably going to benefit a foundational school."
State administrators/legislators/board,215,"You might have a high performance school that has terrible systems in place, but they might be somewhere in an affluent neighborhood; if a tier three system benefits and it might be possible that foundational school benefit is."
State administrators/legislators/board,216,"The other connection we had with this K-12 support team is they housed part of that list of score, I mentioned some of the score pieces, there is the SQSS, the School Quality of Student Success, includes dual-credit, ninth grade on track and attendance, and those three programs existed in K-12 support."
State administrators/legislators/board,217,"So we had worked over since I had started here in 2019, and before worked on collaborating, coordinating, when our continuous improvement partners and our CI team started focusing on those high level schools, how was that message also wrapped into what was going on at foundational schools? And how were we connecting tier three schools and tier two schools with foundational schools that had greater success so that they had a partner in the work and they were not feeling like an isolated, ""oh, you are one of those low performing schools, you go over there separate from"" how do we bring them into that whole body?"
State administrators/legislators/board,218,"This is Washington schools, these are Washington schools, and that tier three schools have access to and communication with their opportunity to communicate with foundational tier one schools, that was the work that we we are doing."
State administrators/legislators/board,219,"And we think it is important, we thought it was important, and we think it is important now, but now that our offices have been divided in our own OSPI building, how do we maintain that connection? So that is part of our ongoing discussion; also going back to your earlier question, part of all the things that can get fed into a school or a school district that can compound progress with too many initiatives happening at once."
State administrators/legislators/board,220,"I think one of the outcomes that our agency, and now I am talking about OSPI agency I oversee, or really have anything to do with it all, is to look at what are the technology barriers that students are facing outside of the school building? How are they having the opportunity to engage in school and in school work outside of the building in terms of software and hardware and connectivity, so having that discussion, it was very much part of the earlier discussions that we had."
State administrators/legislators/board,221,"And a lot of the articles I had read in the newspapers would focus on, a family of five having one computer and not great internet access, or setting up internet access sites in a parking lot of a school, so you can drive up your car on a laptop during your battery life; how is our current reliance on technology impacting the schooling experience for students? And this is probably when you are looking at your low socio-economic status or your economic inequities, is what I am focusing on here with this technology."
State administrators/legislators/board,222,"I think highlighting that ongoing thing and changing the discussion from what used to be, what was it? The digital divide, I think that is gone; I do not think we use anymore, but saying, ""okay, what is this next generation of technology escalates and improves our systems?"" And COVID-19 forcing families to rely on technology brought that about."
State administrators/legislators/board,223,"The other aspect was the extreme importance of school for so many families as parents try to work, what it meant to try to help children with school work while working a full-time job. The way our societys been structured around having a school, where students go and parents go to work and they go their separate ways."
State administrators/legislators/board,224,"Due to COVID-19, that system was lost and really exposed a lot of...I believe in the system for low wage workers who did not have the opportunity to say, ""Okay. I am going to stay home today, I am working from home because I have... I am going to stay home this year, because I have to help my student get through first grade, or fifth grade or 12th grade."" And then more affluent families have that opportunity. They have the access to technology, the flexibility that works. again, that highlighted now, is there an opportunity? I do not know."
State administrators/legislators/board,225,"That is outside of the education realm, what we focused was getting that access, like how do we improve technological access for our students who do not have it, who do not have it now, who will not have it in two years or three years unless we introduce."
State administrators/legislators/board,226,"Your question was access to reliable information. And so when I am talking about information, usually what I use would be state data, and state data change dramatically under COVID-19 in ways that seem very predictable, in ways that may not seem predictable. It is to the point where if you go to our report card, we still have a warning say, ""interpret all data from 2020 to current data with caution."" Because things have shifted and we do not really know if this is a shift that is meaningful and important, or if this is a shift and it has been impacting just data work."
State administrators/legislators/board,227,"For example, we can look at attendance and attendance is a good one for our discussion because it is part of that list score, also as soon as COVID-19 happened, schools stopped operating in-person, no one knew how to take attendance anymore, no one really knew what it means to attend the class. Did you have to be in Zoom? Did you have to complete the packet? Going back to that technology question, what if you did not have access to Zoom all day long? What if your parents were working and you did not have technology at all? Were you to be penalized because the school was not open and you did not have a physical space to go? there was and continue to be a lot of discussion on what is attendance and how do we measure attendance; and this feeds into school accountability."
State administrators/legislators/board,228,"Over the last couple years, we have seen remarkable changes in attendance, track the 2019-2020 school year, and you can see overall there was an increase in attendance, but if you look at just the time pre-COVID-19 and compared to other years of pre-COVID-19, so that same span of September to February, it is flat, but at the end of the year, it just really upticks because everyone was like, ""Well, they did some homework or they showed up for Zoom."" Whole system of data collection shifted overnight, and we are still trying to figure out what the implications of that."
State administrators/legislators/board,229,"Other data collection systems shifted overnight, the assumessments instantly stopped in 2019, we were scheduled to start them just before COVID-19 hit, and then schools closed and we were not ready to pivot to doing assumessments at home so that absolutely stopped. It stopped last year, and we just finished signing assumessments for this school year for last year, they were given in this fall, but they are going to count for the previous year because we have to report data for that previous year."
State administrators/legislators/board,230,"So we are going to say, ""okay, we tested in the 2021 window by expanding that window out And then we are going to turn around in March, we are going to assumess students again and it is going to be for this school year."" So we assumessed through this school year for last year, and then we are going to assumess again. So we have this weird data space that we were in as a data person, where were saying, we have data, is it reliable? Or we do not even have any data. What do we do now?"
State administrators/legislators/board,231,"In our world, we have our federal government is saying, ""okay, you have to continue your whistle. You have to continue your accountability system. because that is how we frame inequities and identify inequities and try and provide support. If you are not doing that, then you are not going to get the funding that goes toward that."" How do we do that system when it was designed in pre-COVID-19 and now we are in COVID-19 and we have huge data gaps."
State administrators/legislators/board,232,And what does that mean for students who might be struggling more now than they were in COVID-19? What does it mean for schools that actually might have benefited? There are silver linings even to COVID-19 and so they might have had the opportunity to revamp or redesign their systems in a way that has helped their students. We do not have a way to measure that.
State administrators/legislators/board,233,"We do not have a best way to measure risk during COVID-19. Trying to figure out what are those systems that we have in place? What are the data points that we have in place? And if not, how do we get them back? that is the discussion that has been ongoing since COVID-19 started. It continues in our state. It continues in every state. And as we try to figure out how do we, as is a shift, in our state specifically, how do we use this data gap, this opportunity to maybe change our WSIF (Washington School improvement Framework) score?"
State administrators/legislators/board,234,"There is the opportunity here to say, ""we do not have one because we do not have the data. How could we think about redesign?"" We did it one time. We were supposed to re-identify based on data from 2020, we could not do that. So we expanded our current identification, those schools that were identified in the system, they are going to be identified for the next year, which is this year that we are sitting in now, like they were identified even though we never ran another WSIF (Washington School improvement Framework) calculation."
State administrators/legislators/board,235,"Are we taking this opportunity to say what do we learned at the first round that we can then maybe modify this data gap? but that is a hard discussion in some sense, we are bound by what the federal government says we must measure. There is some comparability, I imagine between states, although only has a few metrics. We have to do these things and we have to weight them at least a certain way."
State administrators/legislators/board,236,"How are we doing them in the data gap and how are we looking at opportunities to improve our system? those are in discussions that we are having, and they are pretty challenging because it is hard to imagine restarting a program, let alone restarting with new data metrics."
State administrators/legislators/board,237,"Other states are doing a school survey, a student survey, and it is run almost like an assumessment in these schools where every student is asked to participate in a survey of their school. And the questions are about, they can be things about cleanliness of school, safetyness of school. Do you feel bullied at school? Do you have good interactions with your teachers? Do you have someone in your school, an adult who can turn to? So there is a bunch of different of these school climate surveys up there, and we have talked at one point about, what would it look like to include a school climate survey in our WSIF measure so we had attendance, we had ninth grade on track and we had this other metric, which is school climate survey."
State administrators/legislators/board,238,"what would it look like to do that? There is a lot of work with partners, traditionally called stakeholders out there, schools, school districts, parents, community members, because the questions that would appear on that survey would have to be approved, but they also have to be vetted. We have to do a pilot. We have to do all those things to make sure that our questions are valid and reliable and all those psychometric pieces would go into this work."
State administrators/legislators/board,239,"In taking a leadership role, it would be the state, the state and the state-Board-of-Education and say,""this is what we are proposing to do. We are proposing this outline, what the proposal looks like."" but then it is a lot of outreach to communities, community members and schools, and to say ""we are going to revamp this. We are going to add this in. And with the addition of a new metric, we are going to reweight what we already have."""
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,314,"The state does not make those resources available. We have grant money that we have received in order to begin the journey. And then it is identifying research, it is so layered. So we have some money set aside where we can do the thing, but then now we need to find the researcher and who is going to manage the process, and who is equipped internally to be actually be able to do that a lift? I do not know."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,315,"It is incredibly cumbersome, and we are fortunate because of the platform that we have the privilege to carry. People are willing to give us resources to do that stuff, but even we get the resources and we cannot actually do the thing yet because of all the other steps that are involved."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,316,"but generally speaking, the state does not provide those resources at all. We had to find outside grants that we are willing to resource that part of our effort."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,317,"It is super layered. So lets say you have a new administrator in a building, a new principal. First year, second year, third year, wide-eyed and hopeful. And they say, "" what? We are going to reduce suspensions and expulsions. And we are going to create inclusive classrooms and make sure that young people have their behavior listened to and not criminalized."" They enroll this possibility with their assistant principals and the teachers, everybodys on board. School happens. Teachers are in the classroom, there is a young person that is being disruptive, and now the teacher wants to send that young person someplace. The principal then tells that teacher, I am sorry, you need to keep them in the classroom because our new way forward is we are not kicking kids out of class. Then the teacher says, I cannot actually teach with this young person in here. What do you want me to do? Eventually it wears down."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,318,"The union potentially gets involved, because then you are asking teachers to potentially do things that are outside of their scope in supporting the classroom space, and then the administrator wears down and before it we are back into antiquated practices again. It seems like a really horrendous loop because the adults in the building who have the privilege are the ones who are constantly making decisions on behalf of the young people who do not."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,319,"It is our conviction as an organization that those that are farthest away from power and position should be the vested stakeholders in decision making. that is messy and complicated and does not create clear lines like bureaucracies do, but to embolden those who are most impacted to be decision makers then begins to change the dynamic, and often the behavior, of the young people who are on campus, because it is a different level of efficacy that they hold and a different level of responsibility they carry for their actions."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,320,"That is not a through line to our advocacy program per se, but that is the lens that I hold in the broader bureaucracy of schools and the way that power is held and manipulated."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,321,"(Examples of where a school community does center students voices, family voices, does start to create that model of valuing and centering those who are furthest away from power) No. Not that it does not exist, I just have not seen it. Everythings so reactionary at a school level, particularly, and the school calendar is obscene. It is just the cadence of it. So end of August, you have like two weeks to train teachers up and give them an opportunity to get reset for the new year. And then the school year happens, and then you are in the rhythm of the school year, and then there is winter break, and then before it is January, and here we are in January, and then before it is spring. And then you are counting down until June and you are planning for next year already. And then the teachers are off, and then the administration office building closes down at some point in time at the end of July, beginning of August. what I mean? And then here we are again."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,322,"There is not actually time to reset the thing to begin to do something different unless we do it on purpose. We had a school district reach out to us up North who was interested in our programming, and we were interested in co-laboring with them, but what we said we needed to do first was engage parents in the community, those who would be impacted, do some asset mapping to understand what the parents really want and what the young people really want, and if what we offer is aligned with that, then we are willing to co-create something with the school district and the community that would provide that service. They went with someone else because they were willing to just do a program."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,323,The bureaucracy does not really carry a place where they center the voices when it comes to the build of the very interventions or educational models that are supporting the young people who are most distant from educational justice.
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,324,"but there is one offs, I think Highline does a great job in some respects in some areas, but again, I am a homer, because that is the district I grew up in and where our office is at, so I am almost proximate to it, but it is still not like a... There is no model for it. And I do not think the calendar of the school year provides for that."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,325,I will also say that I think it is incredibly inequitable to have summer breaks. That is another antiquated model that I do not know why we still hold onto except white people really enjoy their vacations.
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,326,"(If the state were to do away with summer and do year-round calendar, you think that that would enhance equity?) absolutely, because there is so much learning loss that happens. And we watched that over the pandemic, and what are we really building to here? It is not like were in an agrarian society where we need our young people to be working the farms. What are they doing in the summer? We know what is happening to young people in the summer in the inner city spaces and how challenging it can be with absent of consistent structure and living in neighborhoods that are suffering from the disease of violence. Having year-round schools seems like not only a preventative model for harm, but also a preventative model that leads into creating more just educational system."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,327,"The first and foremost is the mental health impacts that have been substantial as a result of the pandemic. And our state woefully resources mental health support. It is ridiculous. As a state, if our budget is our value statement, what our state says is we do not care about people who are suffering from mental health. And if you do not have private insurance, tough luck."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,328,"And to find culturally competent mental health supports is super challenging. And then to find one that aligns with whatever insurance carrier you might have, even more challenging."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,329,I think of staff members that we have here who cannot find them within our insurance and are paying 150 bucks a week. That is 600 bucks a month. Who has that? That is a privilege to be able to resource that.
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,330,"Thinking about how many young people are suffering as a result of social isolation, the returning, the distance learning, all the things that are happening. And we have an excellent opportunity to invest significantly in mental health supports that are coming from non-traditional avenues. Young people do not necessarily want to go to the huge carriers because they do not have relationships with them."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,331,but what about the small and medi size nonprofit organizations who could staff somebody who is a mental health practitioner? But it is difficult for us to become licensed care facilities. And so that is a whole another process.
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,332,"If we can resource a mental health practitioner, we do not have to bill insurance, we can just have the young people see the mental health practitioner. but our healthcare, particularly mental health is set up, is it is only sustainable if it is billable. You largely compensate the cost of mental health practitioners with your reimbursements."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,333,"So we have to do something about that, particularly outside of school and community, but also inside of school, but I think led by community-based organizations. That has to be an immediate need that is met."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,334,We learned that some young people better engage virtually. For some young folks that is a better platform and that we should have the type of flexibility to do a both and approach moving forward and not either or.
Educator,359,"I will use one example from my work in highly capable, which is a couple years ago, the legislature passed a policy to require school districts to focus on equitable identification of students with low socio-economic-status (SES) backgrounds. And that is the first time they have ever called out a disaggregated student group to target."
Educator,360,"And we know in highly capable, gifted, advanced learning, there is pretty much most specialized populations that are not white middle class are underrepresented dramatically in those programs. So that was a step, the first step."
Educator,361,"There is other steps that need to be taken as well as thinking about racial equity in those programs, thinking about language, students with learning English and their access to those programs, students on IEPs. but taking that step was a huge step for our state."
Educator,362,"And actually in our district, we have been focusing in our own practice on trying to make those programs more equitable, especially students being identified for highly capable services for the last seven or eight years."
Educator,363,"but the students on free and reduced lunch was one of the pieces that for us was harder to move even than some of the other student groups that were looking at. And so once the state set that policy, it really forced us to say, now we really do need to concentrate on this. Why is this one not moving? What can we do? And in the last three years, we have grown 20%, so it is really helped us here. through line there from the state down to the local practice level for us. So that is been real exciting."
Educator,364,"Another one, there were just over this last couple years with the pandemic, and I am not going to be able to draw name a specific one exactly, but there have been so many policies set up for emergency funding as far as digital access and even reimbursing families for wifi, just all those different things that have been made available to our district and to our families."
Educator,365,"We are a very rural district, there is 450 square miles in our school district and most of that is just really remote and rural and have no cell phone service, barely wifi. And many of our families have not had access. Our school district has committed to providing hotspots and Chromebooks for the first time ever to anybody who needs them. Chromebooks to all and hotspots to any family that requests."
Educator,366,"Many of our families have four or five students and they may need several hotspots to maintain that connectivity. We have just made that commitment. I think we had over 700 hotspots out for our 3000 students at the height of the pandemic and that was very expensive. So having that policies from the state that came and the funding, that really made a huge difference for us in our ability to support our students in that way, at that time."
Educator,367,"I think it is a mix of the two. the ESSA funds from the federal level have been huge, but the state has had several different programs. a couple of them have expired. There is another grant that we are applying for now, which is going to offset the cost of some ongoing devices that we are trying to continue to purchase. I would have to check with my tech director to, or the IT director to remember the exact name of the ones that we really relied on in the last couple years."
Educator,368,"the other one that has been a huge contributor to our school district is the bilingual educator initiative. And that is a very small, it started the year I was teacher of the year was the year we were advocating for it to go through the legislature and get the funding for that. And there was four school districts that were involved."
Educator,381,"Another one for us is early-learning. we are just starting this TK program. We have 36 students, there is about 250 probably students who come into our kindergarten every year. So it is a very, very small group that we are able to serve as four-year-olds now."
Educator,382,"And our community only has a couple of private preschools. our WA kids kinder readiness data is scary every year. We are in the very bottom of the state. And when you compare that to our SBA data at third grade, it is like, wow, what are our kinder, first and second grade teachers doing? They are amazing. but if you just look at the third grade SBA, you are like, my gosh, these kids have so far to go."
Educator,383,"But we have 70% of our five-year-olds coming in with math skills of a two year old and you have to make all that up. So if we had more state policies to support, and funding to support early-learning programs, especially in a place like ours, where our students do not have access outside of our school district, that would be a huge support for us."
Educator,384,"the biggest opportunity that I see in our school district is our opportunity to think differently forever, about how we listen to families and students and use their voice to drive our decision making. we did that really well throughout the pandemic."
Educator,385,"even recently talking to some of our school-board members, they feel like in our district, their relationship with the community has strengthened throughout the pandemic, which has been completely the opposite of many of our local districts and communities."
Educator,516,"A lot of it, is just sort of institutional issues. Public education is incredibly wide. And administration even more so, and so you get a lot of equity talk about we know we need more educators-of-color, and we need to be recruiting at more diverse array of colleges and universities. We need to be looking at training and building capacity from within, but that is a short-sighted commitment. because it is incredibly lonely and the loneliness in not having your other is hard work."
Educator,517,"And especially as a Native educator, we advocate for students in a lot of different ways to be able to pursue in their culture and to engage in traditional practices that we do not have the professional time to do ourselves. You only have five personal days and your tribe is in Arizona or New York, you are going to eat that up for one cultural event. So there is a lot of knowing sacrifice as we advocate for our students."
Educator,518,"there is also the fact that, that is getting more diversity in front of the classroom has tons of known benefit is. But that is where the conversation stops, and that is where the work begins, because under what circumstance is a non-Native administrator going to recognize my highly proficient cultural way of engaging with students."
Educator,519,"If they have no cultural framework with which to evaluate me and what implicit bias are we receiving from a predominantly, was it 86%, 82% white administrative staff nationally? So we do not have, we can not go up."
Educator,520,"And there is almost never any conversations about getting educators-of-color into that either building or programming administrative position. that leads to back to where you are working policy, who are the people making policy? Who are the ones starting these conversations? you are going back to where it predominantly white administrators, and we do not have that diversity of stakeholders present."
Educator,521,"you are having interesting conversations because sometimes there are direct policy barriers, but then sometimes it is this more sort of amorphous intangible institutional problem as you are going along the way."
Educator,522,"You are university folks, lets get a little radical. education is a settler-colonial institution. It is designed by a group of people to benefit a specific group of people with a specific set of learning. That learning is privileged and your ability to learn and engage in that way leads to a very sort of predetermined pathway."
Educator,523,"The system itself is not inherently designed for social. That said, those of us in the field know how to take advantage of, we just know how to use the system for good. And even if you are looking at the greater structures of the greater settler-colonial institutions that make up this nation. I have always contended that the means for it is own destruction are built in. You get in there and just start pulling out nails until it crbles."
Educator,524,"So there is a certain amount of privilege and opportunity for those of us who have managed, infiltrate in some way. And to make it help steer these archaic and glacial institutions to turn towards justice. it is in the area of governance, and this is something that I have learned along the way, one gatekeeper can make a world of difference."
Educator,525,"And so much of the people in my line of work, we labor at this for our whole careers. it is all about getting gains, holding the line, and hoping the next generation to replace it. but a lot of the major successes, we had one administrator who just came in one day, it is like, tell me everything about Native education. And I was like, it should work. And it is like, yeah, and so it just came in, it started a big relationship and as a gatekeeper, he just opened the gate. He just took the gate off the hinges and he really was one of the most amazing allies I have ever worked with because he had a mentality of damn to say no."
Educator,526,"there is a lot of work that a lot of excellent work that is being done and can be done within the institutions as they are. Are there better ways? Absolutely. Is that likely to come within our lifetime? Probably not, but there are places, there are districts, that have looked at, lets completely re-envision the way public education works and runs and they are successful, but they are big lifts. And again, it all comes back to that unmitigated community support."
Educator,527,"if we are continuing down the radical path, is a post settler-colonial state a reality, is that possible? I am one of those that do not think there is because it is not...Algeria. Where are the settlers going to go? So what is the long-term goal? I think so what I envision, at least within my institution is just an ongoing, willingness to oil the hinges on the gates and allow opportunities for education to reflect the students they serve more and more. That we say yes and a whole lot more."
Educator,528,"It is about having an ongoing conversation about what is education and what it serves, and who it is supposed to serve. And the more that our education systems could reflect the values of our communities and the needs of their communities, I think the institution can evolve itself. There are always truly ruinous institutions that just need a hard restart. So I am not attacking those. I am saying the ones that are functioning and are full of really good well-intentioned people wanting to do good work. Who just may not always have the tools or the resources, because it is also equally hard."
Educator,529,"the fact that it is such a wide institution, if you are an ally, it is really hard to do the good work, but a bunch of other people like you. And it is hard, it can be hard to initiate those relationships and to engage in that with them, and build that trust and build that legitimacy. And that is a time factor that goes into it as well."
Educator,530,"the one consistent thing that comes up is so critical for Native people and policy. because we may disappear in data and in education, it is a big problem. And a lot of it is set by Federal Policy. So if, as the only way that we pop up is if we mark American Indian only, or Alaska Native only in on the Federal-Race-and-Ethnicity form. If we are two-or-more-races or Native and Hispanic, we literally disappear. We only become those other categories. that data representation has has major impacts on funding, programming, supports, the whole trickle down of that representation."
Educator,531,"this is some information that I use in my trainings and this, I like the national data because the number difference is so huge. but so you can see there is difference locally. So if we look at American Indian only as we would typically in school data, we still have an increase in population. this is the first time that 2020 census that they have included two-or-more-races, or in combination, and you can see how substantial these numbers change as you go from very local as you grow nationally. And all of that really matters."
Educator,532,"there is a lot of great work. If you have not already spent time with the amazing people, who have already done it as part of what you do on a daily basis. but the Portland Area Indian Health Board has done a lot of great work about decolonizing data. up in Seattle, I think you have what Abigail Echo-Hawk with the Seattle Indian Health Board about decolonizing data. this just looking at the state data, the American Indian, Alaska Native teacher representation, it is tiny. But this is straight from the OSPI website, but if you add other factors, there are a couple 100 more of us out there. So this all plays into like if were looking at..."
Educator,533,"So if were looking at this representation, where are district priorities for professional-development going to be? Because my professional-development needs are going to be different than these ones. And the thing is, if I am leading something that I would benefit from, if I need a training in something I would benefit from, odds are, I would be the one keeping it. So how are we maintaining that professional, that higher professional standard for educators-of-color? And also it gets this vicious cycle like you cannot be what you cannot see. if our first students do not see themselves in front of the classroom and do not see themselves in the textbook, what is the likelihood that they are going to want to work there? that was just a big point with data that I wanted to share."
Educator,534,"There is all sorts of different breakdowns with this, and this is also really important too, because if you look at the becoming Visible report that I willinators did too. Only 34% of people think Natives experience any amount of discrimination or violence. it is not uncommon for people in my position or just everyday life to talk to an otherwise well educated adult and be generally shocked that we still exist. all of these numbers are really critical and it is not an easy solution, and I do not know what it is. But for policy and data people how are we sort of disaggregating this race and ethnicity data? So we can make some really true informed policy decisions."
Educator,535,"if you reach out to office and Native education, they got some great data that they have been running. And so I guess that wraps up the one policy thing that consistently comes on. I do not know why this lingers, but it has been lingering for a long time. it is just an issue of alignment."
Educator,536,"So what I do is fund in, in large part by title-six Indian education, and then you have title-three, which is predominantly, traditionally English language learning (ELL). but there is a category in there for Native American students at academic risk. for whatever reason, our state definition of title-three, does not align with the federal definition. And because of that, we are losing out on tons of federal dollars that could go to supporting students. And every time it goes in front of the legislature. It just withers on the vine."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,588,"one of the biggest political education moments for us as an organization, has been how much power school-boards have in this state. And a lot of that has come from experience of passing things at the state legislature. And then following that through into implementation, and noticing that really, it is the school-board that makes the decisions. It is the school-board that negotiates the contracts with the teachers union."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,589,"some of the work that we have done at OneAmerica votes on our political side, is to invest more in supporting school-board candidates from our communities, mostly women-of-color, not only to run, but to run on an equity platform, and on a platform that represents the values of our membership of the people that the system should be serving. to govern well. because I think that we have seen good people go into school-board seats, and then they either sink or they do not have enough critical mass to get stuff done."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,590,"it (advisory structures as supplements) is underdeveloped. part of the reason is, and it is particularly underdeveloped in how they relate to school-boards. I think inside a districts, there is a lot of, like most districts have some infrastructure in which they are engaging the community or parents. but I think my question there is that real decision making power, and then where is the accountability?"
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,591,"Most of the ways that community engage with school-boards is through public comment at their public meetings. And a lot of times those meetings are inaccessible. And that is why getting people who have to have a lived experience and are representative of BIPOC and immigrant refugee communities into those seats is so important, because we have seen a lot of our candidates do things like implement translation and interpretation in the school-board meetings. hat is a huge gap, and I think that it is part of what is adding to the power differential."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,592,"the other structural problem with that is that, school-boards are basically voluntary. So even if there was like an advisory board that the school-board members should be meeting with regularly and getting input and guidance from, that they are not resourced to do that. there are some promising practices, for example, like Head Start has had these parent advisory councils for decades now. And we have seen parents come out of that experience, because it is so much about leadership and development, that is the thing."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,593,"the other thing that is really difficult, what districts sometimes do, is they have an advisory body, they pluck people from the community and say, Tell us what to do. And there actually has to be an investment in co-leadership development, the district has to learn, like how do I actually engage in a way that is about like, our collective self interest? And how do I utilize my power within a system to move things. And the community has to be invested in to understand how the system works."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,594,"I have heard from so many parents ""can you go to this meeting?"" They have shown up, they have been so overwhelmed with the acronyms, the lingo that they just feel even more disempowered. I think like the conditions, it is like the structure, and then the investments we make in the people that are showing up to that structure."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,595,"The other thing l will mention is the importance of a parent and family and community engagement. And I think that it is really important for who are exploring how to impact the K-12 field to not just focus on outcomes and academic programs, but on the ecosystem of the school."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,596,"we have tons of research on the importance of parent, family and community engagement, but I think a lot of systems do not do it well. And one of the key levers that we have been able to work on over the last few years is one, policies that advance language access for parents."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,597,"we have explored things over the years of like weighted funding formulas. there is a real flaw in the way that the funding formulas work now. And a lot of political will, and capital is going to be needed to tackle that."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,598,"there is probably in the next decade, that is the fight in some ways. there is of, to your question about governance, I actually think we need to take a step back and look at, what is the power that the state board has? What is the power that OSPI has? What is the power that the legislature has? And what are the power that districts and unions have? These are the key players that are making decisions about the education system. And I think we often are, like Uber focused on the legislature. but having an aligned agenda for all these entities, I think it is going to be key. But yeah, the funding formula is flawed. It is not rooted in equity. It gets us the basic guts."
State nonprofits/advocacy orgs,599,"the current funding formula basically assumes that kids enter the system on equal footing. You may get more if you are low-income for Title-I, or Title-III. but actually, there is no accountability at the district level that that money is going to serve those kids. So, it assumes the current funding formula is student-based, like it just assumes that all kids are coming in with the same needs, with some exceptions."
Funder,815,"in Seattle. it is going to be different everywhere. And we are surrounded by federally recognized tribes in this area, in this state. that also have their own unique needs. So equity is just being very intentional about the resources and support that we provide to get folks to that point, whatever that point is for them."
Funder,816,"Success can be a number of things and it can look different, but for me it is, do not give someone an apple if they do not need an apple. You give them whatever they need and that is very specific. And so it can look all kinds of ways, I think."
Funder,817,"So I am less familiar with policies. this is a few years back that the legislator passed the Since-Time-Immemorial, the curriculum. So I think that exists as a good example. Now the implementation, however, has not been consistent and there is not a lot of follow through. that in my opinion has room to grow. but I definitely think that is a move in the direction."
Funder,818,"I wish I knew more about really specific statewide or local policies. I am sure if I thought about it, I can think of them, but in this moment. Because my work has really been outside the school system, I interact with it and I have a good knowledge around how the school systems impact our communities."
Funder,819,Schools are a form of assimilation. They were used as ways to remove our people from community and their families in a really horrible way with the boarding schools. So I can speak to that and how that continues to perpetuate itself in school.
Funder,820,"the boarding school system was intentionally forced upon our communities here in the United-States and in Canada. And it was a way to get rid of, kill the Indian and put them at a desk and forcing them some to speak English and force Christianity on them, completely separate from their families, which is not how learning and education in the Western sense would have happened."
Funder,821,"Learning and an understanding in communities, generally speaking happens inter-generationally, it happens in a particular place around whatever those ceremonies, medicines are in that community, very much intertwined and interconnected. So that school system was intentional and pulled the kids out and did not let them go back or they never came home."
Funder,822,"how I see that continuing, although here in the state, Washington Since-Time-Immemorial, there still are curriculums and things that diminish or white wash history. And even in the books, they are very minimal if at all, what was and what is. Some folks do not even believe native people are still alive. What are current communities? What do they look like? What are they doing? So it continues to just erase native people generally."
Funder,823,"(standardized testing) I do not find them helpful for students and a lot of folks, they can be super bright and super smart and do not test well. And the fact that students now spend so much time getting ready for tests, these standardized tests that are the policy of which schools, that is related to their funding, if I remember correctly, and teachers performance, they are tied to these tests. it is discouraging for the students and educators who are truly trying to do a good job. And then, how the schools are looking to the outside world, whether or not they are doing well."
Funder,824,"classrooms, it should be, take tests. that is a normal thing. you are going to have to do those things. Lets test our knowledge and see where we are at. Totally valid. but lets not spend an exorbitant amount of time on these tests. They do not help you."
Funder,825,"They train you how to take a test. it is not helpful in real life and if you want to go to college or not, you are not going to have to do that in your jobs. So I think they are a complete waste of time."
State administrators/legislators/board,866,"And so looking at how do we make changes to those structures that can remove those sort of predictable outcomes by race or ethnicity or socioeconomic status? And the board actually had a fairly in-depth discussion about this later, and I have added some additional concepts to that. So things like casts, and other things have been added to that list."
State administrators/legislators/board,867,"the board has articulated some sort of high level goals. And I guess I will send you this too. We have our strategic plan that has our goals in there, but they are around creating around social emotional health students feeling safe and, and supported in their schools, students being able to engage effectively with their communities when they move through the system, schools that support students as they go through the system and reflect the communities that students are engaged with and then supporting, more in the details, successful transition P-12 and then onto whatever is post-secondary."
State administrators/legislators/board,868,"And a lot of conversation around this throughout the state and with the board about post-secondary meaning lots of different things. And in our framework, that is really about the students being able to make and informed and real choice about what they want to do next and having that be essentially fulfilling what fulfills their goals."
State administrators/legislators/board,869,"So the state actually defines this in terms of students being ready for civic engagement, careers, post-secondary education and lifelong learning. And the board has sort of embraced that. it is actually in the state definition of citizenship. we have changed that to civic engagement because I think it might have meant some... Citizenship meant, I think in our minds, meant civic engagement, not technical citizenship at any rate."
State administrators/legislators/board,870,"And then, the boards been really concerned about equitable funding for our system as to support all this work. We do not actually have much policy role related to funding, but it is an area that you cannot ignore as you look at these various issues."
State administrators/legislators/board,871,"I am going to channel of what, we have been doing a lot of listening to different student groups, and I think they are leading us on some of this. And now this is occurring locally and not yet at the state, which would be things like policies to support ethnic studies curriculum, and those sorts of things were hearing."
State administrators/legislators/board,872,"that is somewhat specific, but more broadly, what students are asking for is instructional environment that helps them feel included and recognized and valued in the education system and that they are more willing and able to engage in those circumstances. And so some districts are leading on that. Some schools, some teachers, it is really down to that level. So it almost is not really a policy at that point. but we do know there are a number of districts that are ahead on this and moving forward on implementing these kinds of programs. The board is looking at how to structure a state policy to support that as well. And that really comes into play in two areas."
State administrators/legislators/board,873,"So some of that OSPI has been leading through ethnic studies advisory committee that made recommendations about how we can incorporate ethnic studies across the standards and across the curriculum. And that the board was supportive of that concept, and in addition to that is looking at a graduation requirement. So that is the direction were hoping to go to support that sort of thing."
State administrators/legislators/board,874,"One of the other things were hearing from students and from others is just ways to more broadly recognize and improve social emotional sort of health and wellbeing. And again, that is another area where the board does not really have an explicit role, but what we have been looking at to support that is school climate kinds of surveys, so that we know when were improving or when we have issues to address."
State administrators/legislators/board,875,"And again, this is on where many districts are doing this as a regular course of action and have strategies to improve climate over time. And at the state, we are looking at ways to measure that as well. I think some of the related but not exactly the same kinds of indicators we have seen, this is probably more on the negative side, is seen in school discipline policies and things like that, that could negatively impact, in many cases, the environment from a student standpoint."
State administrators/legislators/board,876,"discipline is one. there is been actually a lot of activity and changes at sort of the state level, and were seeing it trickling out at the local level to change how they do it, but things like exclusionary discipline can be really challenging at best for students and really detrimental for some students. And it is interesting."
State administrators/legislators/board,877,"I will just share because one of my board members has been quite vocal on this, is he is hes raised the concern about even the vocabulary reuse on this and the idea that were not really doing discipline because discipline means something different. What were really doing is punishing kids. And so wanting to put it in that frame of punishment so that were clear about what really is happening. that emphasizes why it is problematic."
State administrators/legislators/board,878,"that is one of the areas I think that we have really disparate implementation of some of our policies, and so I do see that as a barrier for students in a number of different ways. And I will just give a couple of examples, but this is true of a lot of it. So we have set up different policies at the state level to try to enhance or improve opportunities for students and equity and so forth, but they have not always been implemented quite in the way that they were envisioned."
State administrators/legislators/board,879,"And so I would say that is a problem with the policy. So we need to fix the policy if we want it to be implemented properly. but examples would be things like High School and Beyond Plan, which I think the vision for that is an outstanding idea to really help students think early about how they want to structure their, in this case, primarily their high school curriculum so that they can be prepared for what comes after high school."
State administrators/legislators/board,880,"And conceptually, it is great, and there is been a lot of additions to that to try to make the policy work, but it is not actually filling that purpose very well because in many cases it becomes a check the box exercise that is not really making students feel like that they really are have agency in their education."
State administrators/legislators/board,881,"So how do we fix that is the question, one of many questions that we would like to figure out. And so some of that is a local implementation question. Some of it is probably a state policy question about how we structure that policy. And then other policies I think that fall into that same category are things like our approach to dual-credit and some of the other policies we have, again, to support students learning and growth where there is just a lot of inconsistency, and it is not always even clear what the purpose or how students access these."
State administrators/legislators/board,882,And so parents need to be probably involved at a higher level to really make them work well for students or to help them work well for students. I think it impacts students ability to access and use these programs and have the agency that they need to really get the most out of a dual-credit program.
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,973,"I think as far as the availability of the college balance scholarship, that is a real great thing that we have for children. The problem is, is they get those scholarships, eligible for those scholarships in middle school, and then when they get to high school, nobody tells them they got to keep a C average if they want to get the scholarship when they graduate."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,974,"basically, what we do not have in the state of Washington is a set of policies that promote the concept of hope for the children and families. So why would I go to school every day in the state of Washington when nothings going to happen to me if I do not go, nothings going to happen to my parents if I do not go. I have got to be motivated to go to school. So the state no longer incarcerates children who are chronically true or absent. Okay. Great. That may impact the school to prison pipeline."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,975,"but on the other hand, prior to the pandemic, Washington had the 49th worst chronic school absentee as a rate in the United-States. Now, you will not find that on the OSPI website because there is a lot of way to calculate that rate. But there is only one way to actually calculate it. The number of days a childs supposed to be in school versus the number of days they are actually in school. So we do not keep track of the children."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,976,"We do not incentivize the children by having taken a holistic look at creating an atmosphere of hope, especially now at a time when so many children have lost their hope. We have to have somebody in our policy making process, who can look children and families in the eye and say, You can be successful. You need to stay in high school and graduate from high school. And when you do that, we are going to have a path for you, whether that path is going into the trades or whether that path is going to college. Whatever path it might be. but that conversation is not taking place."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,977,"So the schools are in the position of just trying. They have been given this money to address learning loss, and they cannot even find teachers that want to stay after school to do after school programs, because the teachers are so burned out. So the teachers do not have much hope either. We need hope in the state of Washington."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,978,"So in terms of equity, more specifically to your question rather than keep going on these higher rates, I apologize. So for example, we work closely with a number of different organizations like our own MLK family outreach center here in Spokane. So what we do is we collaborate to support them because they are also serving our kids. We all have these kids in common."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,979,"they started a teen technology center. So we went out and we got some of our partners to donate hardware to that center. And we do our tools to schools drive at MLK. So we make sure, again, those kids are getting school supplies, technology. We stopped getting regular school supplies the year before it last because the kids did not need books. They needed earphones and earbuds and this thing. We also tried to take on the issue of internet connectivity."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,980,"we worked with a company who specializes in wireless internet transmission, and try to get other people engaged in that conversation because we know we have low-income neighborhoods and neighborhoods-of-color that have inadequate fiber. Why is not the state of Washington interested in this? So we successfully set up one, the Northeast Youth Center, got them redone in terms of a server and the bandwidth, because a bunch of kids actually had to come to the center to do their schoolwork because there was no way they had bandwidth at home. And then we just recently helped upgrade the internet connections at the Northeast Community Center, which is in the poorest ZIP code in Washington, 99207."
Local nonprofits/advocacy orgs,981,"because we are loud, because I am loud, my people work for me are smart, what we try to do is we try to get out there and push these issues on behalf of the folks that we work with and the children we are serving. And we have been successful in some ways. Not always, but sometimes."
State administrators/legislators/board,1037,"Really having conversations around how the system was really not created for kids-of-color, low-income kids, kids with disabilities and neuro divergent students. then talking about how we can revolutionize the system so that it actually does work for our students."
State administrators/legislators/board,1038,"it is not so much a policy now, but there is a movement towards increasing understanding and knowledge around racial equity and how the system perpetuates things like the school to prison pipeline and how it pushes some students out. movement towards really having school-board members and adults in the system understand what equity means has been beneficial."
State administrators/legislators/board,1039,"The social movement around protesting things like the lynching of George Floyd and Brianna Taylor. I think that has started the movement of understanding that the school system is not created for adults. It is supposed to be for children and that we need to listen to our kids and their guidance as to what they are looking for, I think has been beneficial."
State administrators/legislators/board,1040,"I would love to see more explicit truth in how we educate our kids from the history of the birth of this country, to the purpose of education and the things like the school to prison pipeline, like the new jim Crow, understanding how all of the systems, except for the correction system was created for the supremacy of one group of folks over the oppression of others, would be important."
State administrators/legislators/board,1041,"In Washington State, I know that we have created the requirement for ethnic studies in classrooms. that is going to be incredibly important if we get the professional-development down correctly so that the teachers and the teachers of teachers know what ethnic studies means and how to educate our students throughout the year, as opposed to just in specific months. those are going to be really important."
State administrators/legislators/board,1042,"Then there is a policy coming down around mastery based learning, which is very different from the seat time requirement that we have now of 180 days. I think the ability and flexibility of moving students in and out of classrooms as they master knowledge or need more support in understanding the curriculum is going to be really beneficial for our kids. My hope is that well be able to pass that soon."
State administrators/legislators/board,1043,(can you think of ways that state or local policies are enhancing racial and economic equity?) They are not .
State administrators/legislators/board,1044,"My organization, the EEC, was founded because of the McCleary decision, which was a state court decision that came out in 2012, saying that the state is not fully funding education. The reason that we were founded was because there was a large group of leader-of-color throughout the state that we were really, really concerned that we we are going to defund other systems to fund education, which we have done before."
State administrators/legislators/board,1045,"We have defunded things like Headstart, ECAP, food assistance, rental assistance, mental health to fund education. And at this point in 2012, I think there were a lot of leaders that were just like, ""Enough. We cannot do this."""
State administrators/legislators/board,1046,"The first year of our existence in the legislative session, which was 2013, we were successful in getting $800 million into the learning assistance program, as well as the transitional bilingual instruction program."
State administrators/legislators/board,1047,"The problem with that was is that there is absolutely no accountability to any of those programs. If you start following the money from the state legislature to OSPI, to the school buildings, there us a point in time where you just do not know where the money goes."
State administrators/legislators/board,1048,"Like you have got the budget for the state, you have got the budget for the school district. You have got a sense of what the budget for the building looks like, but there is no way to report out how many students got learning assistance program money and what those programs were used for. And that is a big problem that we have been trying to tackle for the past 10 years-ish."
State administrators/legislators/board,1049,"when you are looking at funding, we have put in almost $10 billion in the last 10 years, but there is really no accountability system to that. We still have 23 different accounting systems that feed into OSPI, and then they have to figure it out."
State administrators/legislators/board,1050,"And most of the folks that work at OSPI will tell you what school districts just do not have the support to be able to account out where that money goes. a lot of those school districts are larger school districts. It is really hard to then say, ""Okay, of the 15,000 school kids that go to whatever school,"" say Tacoma, we know that this group of kids got high cap money and special-ed, we are not able to do any of that."
State administrators/legislators/board,1051,"while the policy of putting more money into a K-12 has been beneficial for some school buildings and school districts, it has not been the school districts that need the money."
State administrators/legislators/board,1052,"Like the way that we have been playing around and nibbling at the edges of the prototypical model has been that school districts that do not need the money. but because of the staff mix ratio are having staff members work with a lower number of low-income kids or ELL kids or special-ed kids, because of that ratio, they get more money than school districts that have a higher ratio of special-ED, ELL and neuro divergent students."
State administrators/legislators/board,1053,"We have put in a ton of money into education, but we do not know where that moneys going. that is the bittersweet part of it is that we are more than happy to put money into education, but we are loathed to figure out an accounting system or accountability system to be able to answer how many students were served by the transitional bilingual instruction program. And what were those projects?"
State administrators/legislators/board,1054,"(the impacts of McCleary on students-of-color, particularly districts that serve a higher ratio of students-of-color) It negatively impacts them. we have been studying school finances since 2016, and we got a grant to dive even deeper into it and start looking at different states and all of their funding formulas to see if there is a better way of doing it."
State administrators/legislators/board,1055,"because the prototypical model makes one huge assumption, which is really, really detrimental to our families and our students, which is that school-board directors know what a school budgets supposed to do and how to fix it. They do not."
State administrators/legislators/board,1056,"there is no training for school-board directors on how to work the budget. Most school-board directors get their budget and they are like, ""Yeah. We are still in the black. That sounds great."" All of decisions are made by the business office and superintendents. Principals are not part of the conversation. They are not part of the equation and teachers, families and students are nowhere near the conversation of where school money should be going to."
State administrators/legislators/board,1057,"What we have seen is we have seen school-boards make decisions where they basically rubber stamp the balance sheet and then the superintendent and the business office, along with HR end up sending the same amount of money that has been put into really high-income school buildings to pay for their teachers, as well as the same amount of money to going into low-income school districts, to pay for their teachers, which means that at the end of the year, we have low-income schools with low paid staff because they are the newest staff members. They are cheaper. What we end up with is a system that is about buying people. And that sounds horrible, but the system mostly is about how much money can we spend on how many people."
State administrators/legislators/board,1058,"We end up getting school buildings that have high low-income, high percentage of ELL students, high percentage of special-ed students, high percentage of multicultural students that need more supports and need more school nurses, student success coordinators. but they are the ones that get the least experienced teachers. That does not mean that they are the worst teachers. They are just the least experienced because they are the least expensive. We get high-income areas with really productive teachers who are also really expensive."
State administrators/legislators/board,1059,"Our kids are being taught by folks who like a year ago got out of the teacher prep programs and they do not have the experience for classroom management. They do not have the experience for how to meet standards, how to excel standards, how to teach to the test, like all of the things that we expect our teachers to have, they do not have because they have never been in the classroom before."
State administrators/legislators/board,1095,"The Gates Foundation just did a report in February around McCleary that they delivered to Bill Gates around how has McCleary been effective, if it has at all? They did about two and a half months of a lot of data collection, a lot of data analysis. They took of the 295 school districts, they took a quarter of those school districts, urban, rural, and suburban. And tried to mitigate what those school budgets would look like outside of CARES money and outside of pandemic money. In five years of the 25% that they took, all of those school districts are going to be insolvent."
State administrators/legislators/board,1096,"there are school districts that are so on the cusp of being flat broke because of how we fund education and how little people know about education funding and what that is supposed to look like that in five years, by the year 2030, they are going be closed."
State administrators/legislators/board,1097,"not just talking about one school district that is like a schoolhouse that houses like 50 kids. We are talking about school districts in King County. We are talking about school districts in Spokane, in Yakima, in Chelan, we are talking about a mix of school districts that if we do not get our shit together, they are going to close and we are going to have to figure out how to educate these kids. And those are kids that are majority kids-of-color, majority ELL (english language learner), majority low-income."
State administrators/legislators/board,1098,"And it is horrifying that there is not enough people in the legislature. And that OSPI that are beginning to ""wait a second."" And this study is not something that OSPI does on a regular. It should not take the Gates Foundation to try to figure out like, ""are we okay?"" because we are not ."
State administrators/legislators/board,1099,"there are 26 different accounting systems that random school districts use and OSPI has to collate all of them. We cannot even say that we are matching dollars to dollars because there are some school districts in which the superintendent is the accounting office, because they are so small. Of the 295 school districts, 156 are less than 3000 people."
State administrators/legislators/board,1100,"even if you look at the website for OSPI, finding the financial information, you got to dig for it. That should be friends center. I donnot care who your new president Biden nominee for whatever the hell it is, get that off it. The finances of your school districts should be the first thing I see on your website. And you have got to really dig for the 2020 K-12 financial report, the budget."
State administrators/legislators/board,1101,"but the question of how does the legislature, how does policy then create equity, recognizing that students arrive at the schoolhouse door with differing economic statuses and challenges that I have a lot to say about. And that also goes to I think, the racial equity, but let me stay with the economic equity for a moment and just talk about it."
State administrators/legislators/board,1102,"It means that we, as an educational system have to be able to differentiate among the needs of our students. A student who is homeless is probably going to need a lot of additional social support so that they can be physically and mentally prepared to absorb learning."
State administrators/legislators/board,1103,There are things that I think that do fall within the responsibility of our educational system. And I would also say there are things that are beyond what the educational systems can or should be asked to take on. but it does become the responsibility of the broader state government and how do we then integrate all of those systems so that we are supporting that homeless student to be able to be ready to learn.
State administrators/legislators/board,1104,"So to me, it is being able to differentiate the needs of our students, those that are both academics, as well as those that are not academic in nature, but are necessary to be able to promote the academic pursuit. When we talk about racial equity, I think you can talk about that in a couple of ways. So I am going to be very clear about the way I am interpreting this."
State administrators/legislators/board,1105,"And that is that it is my strong belief and it is part of my ethos that each and every student can learn and should have an equitable opportunity to reach this far or their potential as measured by the standards that we have established for general education and for some students as modified by their individualized education plan because again, we have to recognize that."
Local administrators/board members,1169,"And I had to get real with some colleagues, some of my white colleagues and colleagues of-color, about checking that out and checking in, like, Am I just being a coward here? And the consensus that I have heard is, ""No, that is the work. You cannot blow up the community and expect that you are going to unify and move things forward."" I think that is where John Krownapple and Floyd Cobb's work really resonated for us, is I am not sure that you could take anyone on a political spectrum, or a gender identity spectrum, or a religious spectrum and say, So, you are telling me that you do not want all kids to feel like they belong? that is a hard one to argue against."
Local administrators/board members,1170,"i have found that that work is really resonating well for our community. And even some of the staunchest, you are doing critical-race-theory (CRT), even though they cannot define it people, I just give them the book and I say, here is the book we are going to be using to train staff. now, we are building a internal common dialogue, and building goals before we do external planning with community members. Give this book a read, and if you see something in there that is concerning, lets meet again. Now those people, I have not had one person that I have given the book to meet with me. Now, it could be because they are not taking the initiative to actually read the book, that could be true. but I think that says something about how committed they are to their cause, if you are not willing to read the book, probably not so committed. But it is also real hard to argue with, that there is just some people that should not feel like they belong. That narratives not going to get folks far."
Local administrators/board members,1171,"That is our current focus, is this concept of belonging. And were taking a slow path into this, in that this year has been about the district and building level leaders learning together with Floyd Cobb and John Krownapple to really understand the language, build a common language, build a common vision for what does it mean when were doing belonging at the fullest extent possible? This spring, well be ready to start to engage in a deeper level of data analysis that will then culminate with empathy interviews with those groups of people that were seeing through the data are not exhibiting the attributes of belonging."
Local administrators/board members,1172,"it so aligns with my core value, is if you go to the people who need you the most and ask them the questions, or give them space to tell you what they need, they will tell you what they need. And it is often, in my experience, is often way less complicated than we try to make it."
Local administrators/board members,1173,"Sometimes we think these solutions need to be these huge, whatever. And really, that is not... They want access to tutoring, like, Oh, okay. We could do tutoring. What? Okay. It just may be something that... Now, sometimes they are big, and heavy, and hard. but sometimes they are not, and you only know that through asking."
Local administrators/board members,1174,"as an education system, we do a really good job at solving problems that we have not asked. Solving the wrong problem, because we have not asked the question. We work really hard on these big system wide solutions that are expensive and complicated, and then you meet with the parents and they are like, ""Yeah, but I just wanted tutoring,"" and there is still no tutoring. it is like, ""Oh, I did not realize. I can do that, because you do not ask the questions up front. And I do not know if it is from a place of arrogance, or I do not know what that is about, but I think we do that as educators. Or maybe the responsibility that we think we should know, and to ask shows some vulnerability and weakness that maybe we do not know. I do not know why we do what we do."
Local administrators/board members,1175,"The very first thing I am going to tell you about does not have anything to do with the three things you wanted me to focus on, but I think it is a policy that needs to be elevated and shared. The OSPIs commitment to dual-language programming and encouraging... And they did a phenomenal job. Chris Reykdal and his team did a phenomenal job in messaging statewide why that is important. The narrative that they shared was so well done, around there is the moral imperative of it, but then there is also the business case for it."
Local administrators/board members,1176,"I think that that was tremendous for a district like Pasco. We have had bilingual education for decades, and decades, and decades. We have what is called a late-exit program, and the way that that program had been administered, it was what is called subtractive. So the kids are transitioning out of Spanish into English. that is not ideal, and the goal really should be bilingualism, biculturalism, and biliteracy for really anyone and one who wants that."
Local administrators/board members,1177,"We were trying internally, and this is not a criticism of the past, it is what the research had in the past, was this concept of late-exit, where you use their native language to build up their language skills, to transition them into English. So at some point they are getting of support in their native language, but their day is mostly... So you are aware. Okay. So you can see where their native language is not honored in that system as an equal-to, or even more than English. And again, it is not a criticism of what the district was doing. that is what the research said you should be doing back then."
Local administrators/board members,1178,"Then, once we knew better, we were in the process of trying to make that shift. Which was tricky, because you had to like, we were not doing it well before..."" So it is just tricky, how to make that... At the same time, OSPI leveraged this amazing set of policies, and narrative, and statewide expectation, around dual language. It gave us that perfect... It was like we just had to thread the needle then. We are wanting to do this work, we are prepared to do the work, so we stepped through that. And we are now shifting all of our programs to dual-language, whether it is one-way or two-way, and we have expanded our two-way dual-language program from being in one building, or two buildings, to nine buildings."
Local administrators/board members,1179,"I think the thing that we have been able to do in that shifting, in that transition, is really clarify our commitment to bilingualism. And especially for our families who are second language, around that is your heritage language, that is the language of your ancestors. That is what connects us to who we are and the generations who came before us, and how important that is."
Local administrators/board members,1180,"I am not bilingual, but being a person that is not a people-of-color, I think carrying that narrative has been really powerful in this community. And I am proud to be in a position to be able to do that."
Local administrators/board members,1181,"So we are living that in Pasco. We are opening doors around bilingual education and dual-language classes. it is not perfect. We do not have it everywhere. but the philosophy is in place, and we are making the kinds of system changes and shifts that we need to. it is the policy and the state level narrative that help helped us do that in a way that did not divide people. Our board, who is very divergent in opinion, unanimously supported that shift. In a community like this, that is complicated that way, to get unanimous support for something like bilingual education, dual-language for everyone, that could have only been done with the state level policy and narrative from OSPI."
Local administrators/board members,1182,"they were shaping that narrative. It was a strategic priority for Chris Reykdal to increase dual-language statewide. So at the same time they were doing that, there was some flexibility in funding and then some grants. I think those things probably were more beneficial for other districts to be able to thread the needle. We were pretty squared away, funding wise, because we were already doing it, but it was while they were implementing the new grants, that narrative, that they were... The policy level discussion, I guess I should not call it a narrative, the policy level discussion at the state identifying this as a priority, I think was that shifted it for Pasco."
Local administrators/board members,1183,"but I think in districts that were not already on board, with already having a dual-language, there were some grant opportunities and some funding flexibility that was allowed that was helpful."
Educator,1244,"In 2018, we had a major financial crisis here in Spokane and we had to layoff a substantial amount of teachers. My school had 16 teachers laid off. It was, by far, the most in the district and of all the layoffs in Northeast Spokane, which is the poorest part of Spokane, I think something like 60% of all the layoffs came from that part of Spokane. So, it was pretty significant and real obvious. And I had some pretty heated conversations with the union about it and they are not going to move. They do not care. So that is going to continue to be of a hangup because the district does not have total control, like they do over principal hire. I think that is a bigger issue, probably more at the state level, maybe even at the national level."
Educator,1245,"I am not an anti-union person. I think the WEA and the NEA have done some remarkably great things. For teachers, that have benefited the entire profession. however, some of the antiquated ideas of seniority definitely have a negative impact on schools. And even at the quality of curriculum or quality of instruction is limited by some of the things that the union requires."
Educator,1246,"I can give you the specific example because I thought it really hard. So while we were in online learning, for example, so Spokane was in online learning at the secondary level until March 1st. And then March 1st, we went into a hybrid model in which half our kids we are going to come to school one day and the other half the next day. but there we are families who were heavily impacted by COVID-19 and their students we are going to be unable to come, even in the hybrid model. it would have made sense to me, since we were using... Our platform is Microsoft, so it would have made sense to me that students who could not attend could still attend through Teams with their regular classes like the ones they had been in pretty much all year. The union would not let that happen."
Educator,1247,"And so they negotiated (union) that teachers would not be required to teach online and in person at the same time. And so I had four students, could not come to school, could not get into our Spokane Virtual Academy because they had to get in at the beginning of the year. honestly, because I had an open, endorsed certificate that I can teach K-12 any topic, any subject, I just took them all. And it... running a very lame, to be honest, but it was the last three months of school so we made it work. And I had some help for sure. but that to me was pretty damaging because we are talking only 40 kids. It was not that many kids, we should have been able to make an accommodation for that."
Educator,1248,"And I think going forward, what we did find from online learning is that lots of kids, who have high anxiety, did performed really well and because they did not have that anxiety. And so you could really see what they were capable of, educationally. So, I think at some point in time, we are going to have to continue this anyway, we are going to have to have this as an option, forever."
Educator,1249,"And I think that kids should still have the opportunity of their home high school teacher and be able to do that and through Teams, it does not seem that hard to me. So I do think we are going to have to make some there... because I would say my school had the highest number and it was only 40. No other school saw that number, like that. And I have lots of kids living with grandparents who would have had compromised immune systems and could not take the exposure to COVID-19, which definitely happens at schools, as we have found out."
Educator,1250,"I also continue to be concerned about how curriculum is delivered and for a variety of reasons, not all just the union, but definitely they have a place in this. I think everybody has a place in this. Can a district ensure that a kid, in a poor school, is getting the same delivery of curriculum as a kid in a higher income school, because that also can affect that outcome. that is a tough one because you do have some autonomy that is going to happen in every classroom and it should happen. Teachers should have some autonomy, but in the end, kids should be getting whatever the district approved curriculum is."
Educator,1251,"There should be some accountability that a kid on the north side is going to get the same delivery of instruction as on that south side. And I think that is still a gray area for schools and it is hard. I would not say that I necessarily have any solutions, I mean ones that think the union would accept. Let me say it that way. And I think that will continue to be a gatekeeper in a lot of schools."
Educator,1253,"I think there is that would be one area that I think might need some work about. I do not even know where I stand, really, on common core standards. I like the idea of standards. I think that does help deliver a more equitable curriculum to students. but I think they are still fuzzy enough that it just simply does not happen. I know it does not happen."
Educator,1254,"I actually like the data points that the state uses for the report card. they are actually pretty decent because they get into the things that I think oftentimes were ignored, attendance. it is taking dual-credit classes, those kinds of things. I think those are good. they are also using the state testing, which is one data point. It should not be the end all, be all, but it is one and it is important. So I think that is a good one."
Educator,1255,"I also think we have to be better and we are pretty good about tracking students after high school and what they are doing. So we can track them in postsecondary education. We can track their success, persistence to the second year, their graduation of postsecondary all those things. I do not think we look at them quite enough or that every school looks at them quite enough. I think those are indicators."
Educator,1256,"there is another indicator that I think we actually need to keep track of kids for about a decade after high school, the track what they did because what we are seeing now and I do not know why exactly, but in the last couple of years, even before COVID-19, certainly COVID-19 impacted this as is just sometimes kids come back to school after having left. So they graduate from high school, they go and they have this job that they like or whatever, and they do that and then two or three or four years later, then they go to school. I think it would be interesting to see that because that does indicate a...maybe even in some ways, higher degree of success by the school, because they we are still able to do that after four years. That tells you something about what the public school system has been able to do."
Educator,1257,"those data points would be very interesting and it is also, I think we have to look at it career wise, because there are really important jobs to our society that we have to have people do. We have to have car mechanics. You cannot send that anywhere else and we have to have it. So it would be good if we could see how many of our kids do that successfully. How many of our kids going into electrician or plumbering or other things that cannot be outsourced. These things are important to the whole general makeup of our society. I do think that we have to somehow be looking at those data points as well."
Educator,1258,"Honestly, the data point I probably use the most and thought was the most accurate, I mean in the end it ended up being the most accurate was actually the SAT. So, at one time in Spokane, we used to take the PSAT 8, 9, 10, 11, and you could really track some data there that was pretty powerful. And college would have a lot of access to resources that we could also use that I thought were really good. So I thought that was a good data point."
Educator,1259,"but now with the SAT not being used as much in colleges, it is becoming a thing in the past. And so now we are looking at end of course type exams or just benchmarks along the way, as that a district would develop. We have not necessarily developed them. But I think that we will."
Educator,1260,"our elementary and I think up to middle school use a couple of different programs, Lexia and DreamBox. They do indicate a kids point in time they use it regularly. So they use Dreambox, they use Lexia regularly and so a teacher can keep track of a students improvement or lack of improvement and then be able to put the spots into place. And so we are using that at the elementary level."
Educator,1261,"This superintendent has a very strong belief that we need to put a lot of effort and money into the K-4, make sure the kids come out of that reading and with numeracy skills, because then we think we will not have to do all the intervention that we end up doing in high school. that is one reason why it is such a hard end, it is a [inaudible] DreamBox, so Lexia at that level, but does go all the way up into middle school."
Educator,1262,"At the high school level, we use MATHia because we are connected to Carnegie Math. And so math is one of the ways that we can generally track a students progress in math."
Educator,1263,"(what mechanism would help the policymaker, education leaders more likely to utilize evidence data) I do not know. It all always seems to come down to money., I do think that data has impacted them. they saw the disproportionate discipline data, created some laws around discipline that were really tough on schools, to be really honest. And yet, they were, the policy was. We might not have liked it at first, but the policy was"
Educator,1264,"And so I do think that sometimes that is what they have to do. They have to make laws that make us change. Schools are not real great about change. So I do think that those policies, like the discipline policies, and they continue need to create the new rules, and this is a federal one, the new rules around Title-IX, certainly have an impact on schools that I think is good. it is changing something that needed to be changed."
Educator,1265,"I think the most impact I think I have ever seen, in terms of legislators, has been when they are actually in schools. I think sometimes seeing the faces of those that they are impacting sometimes can, along with the data, have maybe the greatest input."
Educator,1266,"I will tell you this, if I wanted my staff to change their mind about something, I did not necessarily try to do it myself. I brought kids in to do it. And it had a greater impact than anything I could have ever said. I would create student panels or whatever. And honestly, if I wanted teachers to change, it was students who we are going to change them, not me."
Educator,1267,And I do think that students... And I do think this generation of students are going to demand something different now that they have had a different schedule and an opportunity for a different way to learn. they are going to demand some differences.
Educator,1268,"I think, for example, I think the high school schedule has to change. It just does not work anymore, especially at the 11th and 12th grade level. And so I think kids will demand that, and maybe that will be it."
Educator,1269,"but if I am picking two things that I think can make the greatest change in schools, and I am sure I told you this before because this has not changed for me, AVID as a national program and GEAR UP, especially in schools of high-poverty and schools with diversity, those two programs... I cannot tell you the data that comes out of that is just ridiculous. if we could just replicate GEAR UP and have every cohort, have every single cohort have a GEAR UP program that follows it from seventh grade to 12th grade, I think you would see some remarkable results, though."
State administrators/legislators/board,1274,"For instance, if I wrote a policy, of education policy, I would write it from my perspective as a Hispanic American, and I would write it for what I believe and not that I was trying to include anybody, just what I was taught. And so it would just not maybe work for the African American kids, or may not work with the Chinese kids, or the Caucasian kids, because I wrote it from my perspective. And so when we talk about racial equity, I think it is just a matter of when you put on the procedures that we have to make sure that we include everybodys perspective into the policy procedure."
State administrators/legislators/board,1275,"a good policy. if I cannot remember what it was then it must be not that great. So there is a lot of policy that is really behind-the-scenes policy, but one of them is data collection. So when a kid gets into, lets say, high school, they come in and they usually look at the kid and they... I do not know if they can or do, but the school does not choose to say, he is a Hispanic, and he is a African American, and he is a Asian, and that is all they know about the kid."
State administrators/legislators/board,1276,"But what we did is we figured out really quick, for instance in the Asian community, you have Asians include the Asian Continent, including Japan, including the Pacific Islander folks who have nothing to do with Asia, they are Pacific Islanders. And there is test scores, there are things of that nature and education are completely different than most of Asia. And so the bill that we pass was to aggregate the data or to separate the data for the kids. (it came out probably in 2019, 2018.)"
State administrators/legislators/board,1277,"For instance, if he is a Hispanic, You ask them, you say, ""Are you a Mexican Hispanic, or are you a Hispanic descent of Mexico, or argumentina or Cuba or Puerto Rico?"" And so we could tell from the data that is coming through, they will mixed a group of kids that are getting affected by a particular class or a part subject matter that they are doing badly in. And instead of just saying then group them all Hispanic or group them as where they actually came from and how they identified themselves. So that was a really good one I think, because now we do not lump all Asians together in column, a Pacific Congress, we separate them to make sure that when we come up with solutions to help these kids or we are coming up for a solution for the kids, that all the kids that are all Asians, or Hispanics, or African Americans."
State administrators/legislators/board,1278,"So now, Unfortunately, for the high schools have this long form that says, Okay. How you identify yourself? And there is probably 100 different ways to identify yourself."
State administrators/legislators/board,1289,"At the local level, I think teachers union like everybody else, they want to help, they want to do the best they can for the kids. I think that what teachers unions are all about."
State administrators/legislators/board,1290,"At the big picture, teachers unions they think they could do the best or the teachers union if they lobby Democrats and not Republicans, because at the state level, I think that is what they believe that Democrats will deal with it, the teachers union, one them to do get the finance to their campaigns when they are running problems."
State administrators/legislators/board,1291,"And I think your experience on the state level and local level gives that contrast. because you have your local union reps that you've worked with and on the state side, there is state level lobbyist, so the dynamics are different."
